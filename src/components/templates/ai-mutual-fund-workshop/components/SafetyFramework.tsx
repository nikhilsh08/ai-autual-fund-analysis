                    <p>
                        The reason you haven't properly looked at your portfolio isn't laziness or ignorance.
                        It's because not knowing feels safer than finding out something is wrong.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you don't check, you can't be disappointed. If you don't verify, you don't have to
                        make a difficult decision. If you trust your advisor blindly, at least someone else is
                        responsible.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-300">
                        But that feeling of safety? It's an illusion. And deep down, you know it.

                            Knowing your funds are actually diversified. Knowing your returns justify the risk.
                            Knowing your advisor's recommendation checks out. Knowing your ULIP isn't silently
                            eroding your wealth.
