                    <p>
                        In China, Gen Z — people in their 20s — have started saving and investing more
                        aggressively than any previous generation. Not because they're naturally frugal. Because
                        they're scared.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        They see AI disrupting jobs. They see economic uncertainty. And instead of ignoring it,
                        they're building financial safety nets NOW — before they need them.
                    </p>

                        The contrast with India is stark. We're still debating whether to even look at our
                        portfolios this quarter.

                    <p>
                        This isn't about fear-mongering. It's about recognising that the world your money exists
                        in is changing faster than ever. AI isn't coming — it's here. The job market is shifting.
                        And the people who'll weather the disruption best aren't the ones with the highest
                        salaries.

                        They're the ones whose money is already working correctly.

                            The good news? The same AI that's disrupting everything else can also be the tool that
                            helps you get your finances right. For the first time, you have technology that's only
                            going to get better with time — and this workshop teaches you how to use it.
