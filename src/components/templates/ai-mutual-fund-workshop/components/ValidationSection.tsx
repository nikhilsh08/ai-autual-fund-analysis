                    <p>You might have ₹1 lakh in mutual funds. Or ₹50 lakh.</p>
                    <p>You might have an advisor you trust. Or you might be doing this alone.</p>

                        What matters is this: you already know your money should be working harder. You've known
                        it for a while. You just haven't had the tools to make it happen — without quitting your
                        job to become a finance expert.

                        You're not bad with money. You're not lazy. You're not "not smart enough for investing."

                    <p>
                        You're missing ONE thing: a way to actually verify what you already know you should be
                        checking.
